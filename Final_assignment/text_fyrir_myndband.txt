Homelessness in San Francisco.

Since the Vietnam war, homelessness has been a big problem in San Francisco.

Looking at the last 10 years, the population has grown nearly 10% and as reported by the World Population Review, it's one of the 20 fastest growing cities in the United States and at 
the same time, homelessness has grown about the same or over 11%. But looking at 311 calls data, complains for homeless concerns has grown over 550%! How can that be?


That's how we get to our project. 
Since San Francisco is a part of Silicon Valley, inequality in the city has grown exponentially, therefore, we want to try and see if a district in San Francisco 
that's getting richer, if it complains more because of homeless concerns.



The genre is a mix of animation and annotated charts because we want to show the user how the times have changed, an easy way to show that visually is with an animation. 
We also want the user to be able to interact with our visualisation and allow him to choose what to look at.
